# libxml2

This folder contains a script to compile `libxml2` using CMake. It is
specially useful on Windows, where building `libxml2` is cumbersome and error
prone. On Linux or macOS you can still use it but `libxml2` supports building
with autotools, so choose whatever you like. However, on these systems you will
likely be able to obtain an already built library, if not already installed on
the system.
